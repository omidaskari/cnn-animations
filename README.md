## What is a CNN?

A **CNN** is a neural network designed for grid-like data (images, audio spectrogramsâ€¦).  
It uses small sliding filters (kernels) with shared weights to extract local patterns.

## What is a Feature Map?

A **feature map** is the 2D output after a convolution + activation.  
It highlights where the kernelâ€™s pattern is found in the input.

## ðŸŽ¬ Episode 1 â€” Convolution

We slide a **3Ã—3 kernel** over a **5Ã—5 input** (valid padding, stride 1).  
At each step we multiply and sum the window Ã— kernel â†’ one output cell.
