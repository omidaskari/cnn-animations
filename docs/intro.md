# CNNs and Feature Maps

## CNNs
- Local receptive fields (kernels look at small patches)  
- Weight sharing (same kernel slides everywhere)  
- Hierarchy of features (edges → shapes → objects)  

## Feature Maps
- Activation maps after convolution  
- High values → filter detected that pattern  
- Different filters → different feature maps
